Start mini server

```bash
$ python -mSimpleHTTPServer 8080
```
Then go to http://localhost:8080/ComfortZone/default.html

This was an experiment to discover what the code would look like for d3.

It was quite confusing how to use the d3 model.

I tried to upgrade to d3 version 4 but couldn't figure out the changes necessary. (Now it's up to version 5)
